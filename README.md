# Password-Strength-Analyser
Weak passwords continue to be a top cybersecurity threat, facilitating data breaches and identity theft. Conventional strength meters use simplistic heuristics and do not take into consideration emerging attack paradigms such as machine learning-based password cracking. 
Current solutions are not adaptable and intelligent in assessing password strength beyond basic heuristics. They do not include emerging cyber threats, and thus they are not effective in giving real-time feedback on security threats.
Existing monitoring systems often fail to provide instant alerts for critical anomalies.

It improves password quality based on AI-generated recommendations. Minimizes the percentage of passwords resistant to brute force, dictionary, and ML-based attacks. The speed at which the tool evaluates and suggests improvements is very less.
